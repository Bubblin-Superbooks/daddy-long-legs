But this particular first\nWednesday, like its predecessors, finally dragged itself to a close.\nJerusha escaped from the pantry where she had been making sandwiches\nfor the asylum's guests, and turned upstairs to accomplish her regular\nwork.  Her special care was room F, where eleven little tots, from four\nto seven, occupied eleven little cots set in a row.  Jerusha assembled\nher charges, straightened their rumpled frocks, wiped their noses, and\nstarted them in an orderly and willing line towards the dining-room to\nengage themselves for a blessed half hour with bread and milk and prune\npudding."

Mrs. Lippett, behind the scenes, did not always maintain that\ncalm and pompous dignity with which she faced an audience of Trustees\nand lady visitors.  Jerusha gazed out across a broad stretch of frozen\nlawn, beyond the tall iron paling that marked the confines of the\nasylum, down undulating ridges sprinkled with country estates, to the\nspires of the village rising from the midst of bare trees."

The\nTrustees and the visiting committee had made their rounds, and read\ntheir reports, and drunk their tea, and now were hurrying home to their\nown cheerful firesides, to forget their bothersome little charges for\nanother month.  Jerusha leaned forward watching with curiosity--and a\ntouch of wistfulness--the stream of carriages and automobiles that\nrolled out of the asylum gates.  In imagination she followed first one\nequipage, then another, to the big houses dotted along the hillside.\nShe pictured herself in a fur coat and a velvet hat trimmed with\nfeathers leaning back in the seat and nonchalantly murmuring 'Home' to\nthe driver.  But on the door-sill of her home the picture grew blurred."
