ever this year--faces the South with two huge windows and oh!  so
furnished.  Julia, with an unlimited allowance, arrived two days early
and was attacked with a fever for settling.</p><p>We have new wall paper and oriental rugs and mahogany chairs--not
painted mahogany which made us sufficiently happy last year, but real.
It's very gorgeous, but I don't feel as though I belonged in it; I'm
nervous all the time for fear I'll get an ink spot in the wrong place.</p></div> </div>
