<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">landscape--ocean-scape,
rather--nothing but water and rocks.</p><p>The summer goes.  I spend the morning with Latin and English and
algebra and my two stupid girls.  I don't know how Marion is ever going
to get into college, or stay in after she gets there.  And as for
Florence, she is hopeless--but oh! such a little beauty.  I don't
suppose it matters in the least whether they are stupid or not so long
as they are pretty?  One can't help thinking, though, how their
conversation will bore their husbands, unless they are fortunate enough
to obtain stupid husbands.  I suppose that's quite possible; the world
seems to be filled with stupid men; I've met a number this summer.</p><p>In the afternoon we take a walk on the cliffs, or swim, if the tide is
right.  I can swim in salt water with the utmost ease you see my
education is already being put to use!</p></div> </div>
