truly.  I'm not the least bit of trouble in the house.  I'm a help.
They don't take up many servants, and Sallie an I can do lots of useful
things.  It's a fine chance for me to learn housekeeping.  Every woman
ought to understand it, and I only know asylum-keeping.</p><p>There aren't any girls our age at the camp, and Mrs. McBride wants me
for a companion for Sallie.  We are planning to do a lot of reading
together.  We are going to read all of the books for next year's
English and sociology.  The Professor said it would be a great help if
we would get our reading finished in the summer; and it's so much
easier to remember it if we read together and talk it over.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Just to live in the same house with Sallie's mother is an education.
