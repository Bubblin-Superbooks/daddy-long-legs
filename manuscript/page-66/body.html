feeling terribly lonely and miserable and sore-throaty the night I
wrote.  I didn't know it, but I was just sickening for tonsillitis and
grippe and lots of things mixed.  I'm in the infirmary now, and have
been here for six days; this is the first time they would let me sit up
and have a pen and paper.  The head nurse is very bossy.  But I've been
thinking about it all the time and I shan't get well until you forgive
me.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Here is a picture of the way I look, with a bandage</p></div> </div>
