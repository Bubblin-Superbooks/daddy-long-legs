<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">three days they gave you up.  Oh, dearest, if
that had happened, the light would have gone out of the world for me.
I suppose that some day in the far future--one of us must leave the
other; but at least we shall have had our happiness and there will be
memories to live with.</p><p>I meant to cheer you up--and instead I have to cheer myself.  For in
spite of being happier than I ever dreamed I could be, I'm also
soberer.  The fear that something may happen rests like a shadow on my
heart.  Always before I could be frivolous and care-free and
unconcerned, because I had nothing precious to lose.  But now--I shall
have a Great Big Worry all the rest of my life.  Whenever you are away
from me I shall be thinking of all the automobiles that can run over
you, or the sign-boards that can fall on your head, or the dreadful,
squirmy germs that you may be swallowing.  My peace of mind is gone for
ever--but anyway, I never cared much for just plain peace.</p></div> </div>
