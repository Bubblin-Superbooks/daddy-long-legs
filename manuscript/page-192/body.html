intensive living after this.  I'm going to enjoy every second, and I'm
going to KNOW I'm enjoying it while I'm enjoying it.  Most people don't
live; they just race.  They are trying to reach some goal far away on
the horizon, and in the heat of the going they get so breathless and
panting that they lose all sight of the beautiful, tranquil country
they are passing through; and then the first thing they know, they are
old and worn out, and it doesn't make any difference whether they've
reached the goal or not.  I've decided to sit down by the way and pile
up a lot of little happinesses, even if I never become a Great Author.
