every three days.  Wuthering Heights.  Emily Bronte was quite young
when she wrote it, and had never been outside of Haworth churchyard.
She had never known any men in her life; how COULD she imagine a man
like Heathcliffe?</p><p>I couldn't do it, and I'm quite young and never outside the John Grier
Asylum--I've had every chance in the world.  Sometimes a dreadful fear
comes over me that I'm not a genius.  Will you be awfully disappointed,
Daddy, if I don't turn out to be a great author?  In the spring when
everything is so beautiful and green and budding, I feel like turning
my back on lessons, and running away to play with the weather.  There
are such lots of adventures out in the fields!  It's much more
entertaining to live books than to write them.</p><p>Ow ! ! ! ! ! !</p></div> </div>
