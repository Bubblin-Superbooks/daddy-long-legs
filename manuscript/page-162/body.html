he meets them in a sort of man-to-man fashion that disarms them
immediately.  They were very suspicious at first.  They didn't care for
his clothes!  And I will say that his clothes are rather amazing.  He
wears knickerbockers and pleated jackets and white flannels and riding
clothes with puffed trousers.  Whenever he comes down in anything new,
Mrs. Semple, beaming with pride, walks around and views him from every

he will pick up some dust.  It bores him dreadfully.  He's always
saying to her:</p><p>'Run along, Lizzie, and tend to your work.  You can't boss me any
longer.  I've grown up.'</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">It's awfully funny to think of that great big, long-legged man (he's
