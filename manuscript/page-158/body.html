postman came, so I'll add some more.  We have one mail a day at twelve
o'clock. Rural delivery is a blessing to the farmers!  Our postman not
only delivers letters, but he runs errands for us in town, at five
cents an errand.  Yesterday he brought me some shoe-strings and a jar
of cold cream (I sunburned all the skin off my nose before I got my new
hat) and a blue Windsor tie and a bottle of blacking all for ten cents.
That was an unusual bargain, owing to the largeness of my order.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Also he tells us what is happening in the Great World.  Several people
on the route take daily papers, and he reads them as he jogs along, and
repeats the news</p></div> </div>
