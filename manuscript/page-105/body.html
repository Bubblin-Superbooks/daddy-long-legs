pleased--but oh, if we could only beat the juniors!  I'd be willing to
be black and blue all over and stay in bed a week in a witch-hazel
compress.</p><p>Sallie has invited me to spend the Christmas vacation with her.  She
lives in Worcester, Massachusetts.  Wasn't it nice of her?  I shall
love to go.  I've never been in a private family in my life, except at
Lock Willow, and the Semples were grown-up and old and don't count.
But the McBrides have a houseful of children (anyway two or three) and
a mother and father and grandmother, and an Angora cat.  It's a
perfectly complete family!  Packing your trunk and going away is more
fun than staying behind.  I am terribly excited at the prospect.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Seventh hour--I must run to rehearsal.  I'm to be in</p></div> </div>
