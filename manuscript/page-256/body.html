Of COURSE I can find the way.  I've been in New York three times and am
not quite a baby.  I can't believe that I am really going to see
you--I've been just THINKING you so long that it hardly seems as though
you are a tangible flesh-and-blood person.</p><p>You are awfully good, Daddy, to bother yourself with me, when you're
not strong.  Take care and don't catch cold.  These fall rains are very
damp.</p><pre><code>                           Affectionately,
