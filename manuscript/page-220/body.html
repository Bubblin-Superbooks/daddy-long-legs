to amount to anything, and that you had thrown away your money for
nothing.  But what do you think?  I woke up this morning with a
beautiful new plot in my head, and I've been going about all day
planning my characters, just as happy as I could be.  No one can ever
accuse me of being a pessimist!  If I had a husband and twelve children
swallowed by an earthquake one day, I'd bob up smilingly the next
morning and commence to look for another set.</p><pre><code>                       Affectionately,
