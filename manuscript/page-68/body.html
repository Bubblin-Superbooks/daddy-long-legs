<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">appeared with a long white box addressed to me,
and filled with the LOVELIEST pink rosebuds.  And much nicer still, it
contained a card with a very polite message written in a funny little
uphill back hand (but one which shows a great deal of character). Thank
you, Daddy, a thousand times.  Your flowers make the first real, true
present I ever received in my life.  If you want to know what a baby I
am I lay down and cried because I was so happy.</p><p>Now that I am sure you read my letters, I'll make them much more
interesting, so they'll be worth keeping in a safe with red tape around
them--only please take out that dreadful one and burn it up.  I'd hate
to think that you ever read it over.</p><p>Thank you for making a very sick, cross, miserable Freshman cheerful.
Probably you have lots of loving family and friends, and you don't know
what it feels like to be alone.  But I do.</p></div> </div>
