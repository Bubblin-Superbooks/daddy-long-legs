<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>Dear me, Daddy, I seem to have a very ejaculatory style today; this
page is peppered with exclamations.</p><p>I meant to have written a lot about the budding trees and the new
cinder path in the athletic field, and the awful lesson we have in
biology for tomorrow, and the new canoes on the lake, and Catherine
Prentiss who has pneumonia, and Prexy's Angora kitten that strayed from
home and has been boarding in Fergussen Hall for two weeks until a
chambermaid reported it, and about my three new dresses--white and pink
and blue polka dots with a hat to match--but I am too sleepy.  I am
always making this an excuse, am I not?  But a girls' college is a busy
place and we do get tired by the end of the day!  Particularly when the
day begins at dawn.</p><pre class="  "><code>                       Affectionately,
