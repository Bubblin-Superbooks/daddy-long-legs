<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>I'd love pretty hats and things, but I mustn't mortgage the future to
pay for them.</p><p>You'll forgive me, won't you, for being so rude?  I have an awful habit
of writing impulsively when I first think things, and then posting the
letter beyond recall.  But if I sometimes seem thoughtless and
ungrateful, I never mean it.  In my heart I thank you always for the
life and freedom and independence that you have given me.  My childhood
was just a long, sullen stretch of revolt, and now I am so happy every
moment of the day that I can't believe it's true.  I feel like a
made-up heroine in a story-book.</p><p>It's a quarter past two.  I'm going to tiptoe out to post this off now.
You'll receive it in the next mail after the other; so you won't have a
very long time to think bad of me.</p><pre class="  "><code>                   Good night, Daddy,
