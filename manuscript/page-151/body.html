pool in the pasture.  There's a frog croaking underneath, a locust
singing overhead and two little 'devil downheads' darting up and down
the trunk.  I've been here for an hour; it's a very comfortable crotch,
especially after being upholstered with two sofa cushions.  I came up
with a pen and tablet hoping to write an immortal short story, but I've
been having a dreadful time with my heroine--I CAN'T make her behave as
I want her to behave; so I've abandoned her for the moment, and am
writing to you.  (Not much relief though, for I can't make you behave
as I want you to, either.)</p><p>If you are in that dreadful New York, I wish I could send you some of
this lovely, breezy, sunshiny outlook.  The country is Heaven after a
week of rain.</p></div> </div>
