24th September</p><p>Dear Kind-Trustee-Who-Sends-Orphans-to-College,</p><p>Here I am!  I travelled yesterday for four hours in a train.  It's a
funny sensation, isn't it?  I never rode in one before.</p><p>College is the biggest, most bewildering place--I get lost whenever I
leave my room.  I will write you a description later when I'm feeling
less muddled; also I will tell you about my lessons.  Classes don't
begin until Monday morning, and this is Saturday night.  But I wanted
to write a letter first just to get acquainted.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">It seems queer to be writing letters to somebody you don't know.  It
