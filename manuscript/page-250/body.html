this morning.  I am so sorry that you have been ill; I wouldn't have
bothered you with my affairs if I had known.  Yes, I will tell you the
trouble, but it's sort of complicated to write, and VERY PRIVATE.
Please don't keep this letter, but burn it.</p><p>Before I begin--here's a cheque for one thousand dollars.  It seems
funny, doesn't it, for me to be sending a cheque to you?  Where do you
think I got it?</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">I've sold my story, Daddy.  It's going to be published</p></div> </div>
