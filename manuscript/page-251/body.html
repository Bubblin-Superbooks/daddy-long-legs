seven parts, and then in a book!  You might think I'd be wild with joy,
but I'm not.  I'm entirely apathetic.  Of course I'm glad to begin
paying you--I owe you over two thousand more.  It's coming in
instalments.  Now don't be horrid, please, about taking it, because it
makes me happy to return it.  I owe you a great deal more than the mere
money, and the rest I will continue to pay all my life in gratitude and
affection.</p><p>And now, Daddy, about the other thing; please give me your most worldly
advice, whether you think I'll like it or not.</p><p>You know that I've always had a very special feeling towards you; you
sort of represented my whole family; but you won't mind, will you, if I
tell you that I have a very much more special feeling for another man?
You can probably guess without much trouble who he is.  I suspect that
my letters have been very full of Master Jervie for a very long time.</p></div> </div>
