in the world; she knows everything.  Think how many summers I've spent
with Mrs. Lippett and how I'll appreciate the contrast.  You needn't be
afraid that I'll be crowding them, for their house is made of rubber.
When they have a lot of company, they just sprinkle tents about in the
woods and turn the boys outside.  It's going to be such a nice, healthy
summer exercising out of doors every minute.  Jimmie McBride is going
to teach me how to ride horseback and paddle a canoe, and how to shoot
and--oh, lots of things I ought to know.  It's the kind of nice, jolly,
care-free time that I've never had; and I think every girl deserves it
once in her life.  Of course I'll do exactly as you say, but please,
PLEASE let me go, Daddy.  I've never wanted anything so much.</p><p>This isn't Jerusha Abbott, the future great author, writing to you.
