<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">came back at night.  Mrs. Semple called me at half-past four.  I
started wide awake in the darkness and the first thought that popped
into my head was, 'I am going to see Daddy-Long-Legs!' I ate breakfast
in the kitchen by candle-light, and then drove the five miles to the
station through the most glorious October colouring.  The sun came up
on the way, and the swamp maples and dogwood glowed crimson and orange
and the stone walls and cornfields sparkled with hoar frost; the air
was keen and clear and full of promise.  I knew something was going to
happen.  All the way in the train the rails kept singing, 'You're going
to see Daddy-Long-Legs.' It made me feel secure.  I had such faith in
Daddy's ability to set things right.  And I knew that somewhere another
man--dearer than Daddy--was wanting to see me, and somehow I had a
feeling that before the journey ended I should meet him, too.  And you
