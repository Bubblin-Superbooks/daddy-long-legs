<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>I'm in the basket-ball team and you ought to see the bruise on my left
shoulder.  It's blue and mahogany with little streaks of orange.  Julia
Pendleton tried for the team, but she didn't get in.  Hooray!</p><p>You see what a mean disposition I have.</p><p>College gets nicer and nicer.  I like the girls and the teachers and
the classes and the campus and the things to eat.  We have ice-cream
twice a week and we never have corn-meal mush.</p><p>You only wanted to hear from me once a month, didn't you?  And I've
been peppering you with letters every few days!  But I've been so
excited about all these new adventures that I MUST talk to somebody;
and you're the only one I know.  Please excuse my exuberance; I'll
settle pretty soon.  If my letters bore you, you can always toss them
into the wastebasket.  I promise not to write another till the middle
of November.</p></div> </div>
