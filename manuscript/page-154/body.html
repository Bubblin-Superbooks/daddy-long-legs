<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>Very hard to get any news into this letter!  Judy is becoming so
philosophical of late, that she wishes to discourse largely of the
world in general, instead of descending to the trivial details of daily
life.  But if you MUST have news, here it is:</p><p>Our nine young pigs waded across the brook and ran away last Tuesday,
and only eight came back.  We don't want to accuse anyone unjustly, but
we suspect that Widow Dowd has one more than she ought to have.</p><p>Mr. Weaver has painted his barn and his two silos a bright pumpkin
yellow--a very ugly colour, but he says it will wear.</p><p>The Brewers have company this week; Mrs. Brewer's sister and two nieces
from Ohio.</p><p>One of our Rhode Island Reds only brought off three chicks out of
fifteen eggs.  We can't imagine what was the trouble.  Rhode island
Reds, in my opinion, are a very inferior breed.  I prefer Buff
Orpingtons.</p></div> </div>
