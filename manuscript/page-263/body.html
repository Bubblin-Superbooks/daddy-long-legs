hundred little things might have told me, if I had had any wits.  I
wouldn't make a very good detective, would I, Daddy?  Jervie?  What
must I call you?  Just plain Jervie sounds disrespectful, and I can't
be disrespectful to you!</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">It was a very sweet half hour before your doctor came and sent me away.
I was so dazed when I got to the station that I almost took a train for
St Louis.  And you were pretty dazed, too.  You forgot to give me any
tea.  But we're both very, very happy, aren't we?  I drove back to Lock
Willow in the dark but oh, how the stars were shining!  And this
morning I've been out with Colin visiting all the places that you and I
went to together, and remembering what you said and how you looked.
The woods today are burnished bronze and the air is full of frost.
It's CLIMBING weather.  I wish you were here to climb the hills with
me.  I am missing you</p></div> </div>
