<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>The people are Mr. and Mrs. Semple and a hired girl and two hired men.
The hired people eat in the kitchen, and the Semples and Judy in the
dining-room. We had ham and eggs and biscuits and honey and jelly-cake
and pie and pickles and cheese and tea for supper--and a great deal of
conversation.  I have never been so entertaining in my life; everything
I say appears to be funny.  I suppose it is, because I've never been in
the country before, and my questions are backed by an all-inclusive
ignorance.</p><p>The room marked with a cross is not where the murder was committed, but
the one that I occupy.  It's big and square and empty, with adorable
old-fashioned furniture and windows that have to be propped up on
sticks and green shades trimmed with gold that fall down if you touch
them.  And a big square mahogany table--I'm going to spend the summer
with my elbows spread out on it, writing a novel.</p></div> </div>
