room; I am very grateful to him for remembering me, but I don't know
what on earth to do with it.  Sallie and Julia won't let me hang it up;
our room this year is furnished in red, and you can imagine what an
effect we'd have if I added orange and black.  But it's such nice,
warm, thick felt, I hate to waste it.  Would it be very improper to
have it made into a bath robe?  My old one shrank when it was washed.</p><p>I've entirely omitted of late telling you what I am learning, but
though you might not imagine it from my letters, my time is exclusively
occupied with study.  It's a very bewildering matter to get educated in
five branches at once.</p><p>'The test of true scholarship,' says Chemistry Professor, 'is a
painstaking passion for detail.'</p></div> </div>
