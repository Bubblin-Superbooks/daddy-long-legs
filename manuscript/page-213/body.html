<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>A letter comes from Mr. Jervis Pendleton in Paris, rather a short
concise letter; I'm not quite forgiven yet for refusing to follow his
advice.  However, if he gets back in time, he will see me for a few
days at Lock Willow before college opens, and if I am very nice and
sweet and docile, I shall (I am led to infer) be received into favour
again.</p><p>Also a letter from Sallie.  She wants me to come to their camp for two
weeks in September.  Must I ask your permission, or haven't I yet
arrived at the place where I can do as I please?  Yes, I am sure I
have--I'm a Senior, you know.  Having worked all summer, I feel like
taking a little healthful recreation; I want to see the Adirondacks; I
want to see Sallie; I want to see Sallie's brother--he's going to teach
me to canoe--and (we come to my chief motive, which is mean) I want
Master Jervie to arrive at Lock Willow and find me not there.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">I MUST show him that he can't dictate to me.  No</p></div> </div>
