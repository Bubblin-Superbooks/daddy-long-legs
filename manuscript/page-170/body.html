or places or ways of living, and then have them snatched away, it does
leave an awfully empty, gnawing sort of sensation.  I'm finding Mrs.
Semple's conversation pretty unseasoned food.</p><p>College opens in two weeks and I shall be glad to begin work again.  I
have worked quite a lot this summer though--six short stories and seven
poems.  Those I sent to the magazines all came back with the most
courteous promptitude.  But I don't mind.  It's good practice.  Master
Jervie read them--he brought in the post, so I couldn't help his
knowing--and he said they were DREADFUL.  They showed that I didn't
have the slightest idea of what I was talking about.  (Master Jervie
doesn't let politeness interfere with truth.) But the last one I
did--just a little sketch laid in college--he said wasn't bad; and he
had it typewritten, and I sent it to a magazine.  They've had it two
weeks; maybe they're thinking it over.</p></div> </div>
