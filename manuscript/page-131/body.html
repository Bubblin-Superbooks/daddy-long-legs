I posted it I was sorry, and tried to get it back, but that beastly
mail clerk wouldn't give it back to me.</p><p>It's the middle of the night now; I've been awake for hours thinking
what a Worm I am--what a Thousand-legged Worm--and that's the worst I
can say!  I've closed the door very softly into the study so as not to
wake Julia and Sallie, and am sitting up in bed writing to you on paper
torn out of my history note-book.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">I just wanted to tell you that I am sorry I was so</p></div> </div>
