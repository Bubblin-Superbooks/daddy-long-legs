engrossing place.</p><p>I had an interesting--and illuminating--time, but I'm glad I don't
belong to such a family!  I should truly rather have the John Grier
Home for a background.  Whatever the drawbacks of my bringing up, there
was at least no pretence about it.  I know now what people mean when
they say they are weighed down by Things.  The material atmosphere of
that house was crushing; I didn't draw a deep breath until I was on an
express train coming back.  All the furniture was carved and
upholstered and gorgeous; the people I met were beautifully dressed and
low-voiced and well-bred, but it's the truth, Daddy, I never heard one
word of real talk from the time we arrived until we left.  I don't
think an idea ever entered the front door.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Mrs. Pendleton never thinks of anything but jewels</p></div> </div>
