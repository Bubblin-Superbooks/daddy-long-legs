<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">impolite about your
cheque.  I know you meant it kindly, and I think you're an old dear to
take so much trouble for such a silly thing as a hat.  I ought to have
returned it very much more graciously.</p><p>But in any case, I had to return it.  It's different with me than with
other girls.  They can take things naturally from people.  They have
fathers and brothers and aunts and uncles; but I can't be on any such
relations with any one.  I like to pretend that you belong to me, just
to play with the idea, but of course I know you don't. I'm alone,
really--with my back to the wall fighting the world--and I get sort of
gaspy when I think about it.  I put it out of my mind, and keep on
pretending; but don't you see, Daddy?  I can't accept any more money
than I have to, because some day I shall be wanting to pay it back, and
even as great an author as I intend to be won't be able to face a
PERFECTLY TREMENDOUS debt.</p></div> </div>
