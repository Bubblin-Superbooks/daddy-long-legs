moment I could scarcely make out anything; then I saw a big easy chair
before the fire and a shining tea table with a smaller chair beside it.
And I realized that a man was sitting in the big chair propped up by
pillows with a rug over his knees.  Before I could stop him he
rose--rather shakily--and steadied himself by the back of the chair and
just looked at me without a word.  And then--and then--I saw it was
you!  But even with that I didn't understand.  I thought Daddy had had
you come there to meet me or a surprise.</p><p>Then you laughed and held out your hand and said, 'Dear little Judy,
couldn't you guess that I was Daddy-Long-Legs?'</p></div> </div>
