companionable we are.  We think the same about everything--I am afraid
I have a tendency to make over my ideas to match his!  But he is almost
always right; he ought to be, you know, for he has fourteen years'
start of me.  In other ways, though, he's just an overgrown boy, and he
does need looking after--he hasn't any sense about wearing rubbers when
it rains.  He and I always think the same things are funny, and that is
such a lot; it's dreadful when two people's senses of humour are
antagonistic.  I don't believe there's any bridging that gulf!</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">And he is--Oh, well!  He is just himself, and I miss him, and miss him,
and miss him.  The whole world seems empty and aching.  I hate the
moonlight because it's beautiful and he isn't here to see it with me.
But maybe you've loved somebody, too, and you know?  If you have, I
don't need to explain; if you haven't, I can't</p></div> </div>
