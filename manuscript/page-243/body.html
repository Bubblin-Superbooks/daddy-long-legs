It's especially fun
when your kind of work is the thing you'd rather do more than anything
else in the world.  I've been writing as fast as my pen would go every
day this summer, and my only quarrel with life is that the days aren't
long enough to write all the beautiful and valuable and entertaining
thoughts I'm thinking.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">I've finished the second draft of my book and am going to begin the
third tomorrow morning at half-past seven.  It's the sweetest book you
ever saw--it is, truly.  I think of nothing else.  I can barely wait in
the morning</p></div> </div>
