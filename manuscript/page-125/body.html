to tell me that you actually live in all that confusion?  I don't
believe that I shall recover for months from the bewildering effect of
two days of it.  I can't begin to tell you all the amazing things I've
seen; I suppose you know, though, since you live there yourself.</p><p>But aren't the streets entertaining?  And the people?  And the shops?
I never saw such lovely things as there are in the windows.  It makes
you want to devote your life to wearing clothes.</p></div> </div>
