How does that strike you, Mr. Smith?  Fancy Jerusha Abbott, of the John
Grier Home, sitting at the tables of the rich.  I don't know why Julia
wants me--she seems to be getting quite attached to me of late.  I
should, to tell the truth, very much prefer going to Sallie's, but
Julia asked me first, so if I go anywhere it must be to New York
instead of to Worcester.  I'm rather awed at the prospect of meeting
Pendletons EN MASSE, and also I'd have to get a lot of new clothes--so,
Daddy dear, if you write that you would prefer having me remain quietly
at college, I will bow to your wishes with my usual sweet docility.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">I'm engaged at odd moments with the Life and Letters of Thomas
