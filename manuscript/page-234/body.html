<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>It's a beautiful day--frozen and icy and clear.  As soon as dinner is
over, Sallie and Julia and Marty Keene and Eleanor Pratt (friends of
mine, but you don't know them) and I are going to put on short skirts
and walk 'cross country to Crystal Spring Farm and have a fried chicken
and waffle supper, and then have Mr. Crystal Spring drive us home in
his buckboard.  We are supposed to be inside the campus at seven, but
we are going to stretch a point tonight and make it eight.</p><p>Farewell, kind Sir.</p><pre class="  "><code>   I have the honour of subscribing myself,
