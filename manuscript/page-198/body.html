<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">the campus is.  I
think you might come and look at it for yourself.  Master Jervie
dropped in again last Friday--but he chose a most unpropitious time,
for Sallie and Julia and I were just running to catch a train.  And
where do you think we were going?  To Princeton, to attend a dance and
a ball game, if you please!  I didn't ask you if I might go, because I
had a feeling that your secretary would say no.  But it was entirely
regular; we had leave-of-absence from college, and Mrs. McBride
chaperoned us.  We had a charming time--but I shall have to omit
details; they are too many and complicated.</p><pre><code>                                                   Saturday</code></pre><p>Up before dawn!  The night watchman called us--six of us--and we made
coffee in a chafing dish (you never saw so many grounds!) and walked
two miles to the top of One Tree Hill to see the sun rise.  We had to
scramble up the last slope!  The sun almost beat us!  And perhaps you
think we didn't bring back appetites to breakfast!</p></div> </div>
