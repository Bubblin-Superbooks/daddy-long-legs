<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">rest of my life in paying my
debts, but now I shall only have to spend one-half of the rest of it.</p><p>I hope you understand my position and won't be cross.  The allowance I
shall still most gratefully accept.  It requires an allowance to live
up to Julia and her furniture!  I wish that she had been reared to
simpler tastes, or else that she were not my room-mate.</p><p>This isn't much of a letter; I meant to have written a lot--but I've
been hemming four window curtains and three portieres (I'm glad you
can't see the length of the stitches), and polishing a brass desk set
with tooth powder (very uphill work), and sawing off picture wire with
manicure scissors, and unpacking four boxes of books, and putting away
two trunkfuls of clothes (it doesn't seem believable that Jerusha
Abbott owns two trunks full of clothes, but she does!) and welcoming
back fifty dear friends in between.</p><p>Opening day is a joyous occasion!</p></div> </div>
