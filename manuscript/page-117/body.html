Professor.  'Stand far enough away to get a perspective of the whole.'</p><p>You can see with what nicety we have to trim our sails between
chemistry and history.  I like the historical method best.  If I say
that William the Conqueror came over in 1492, and Columbus discovered
America in 1100 or 1066 or whenever it was, that's a mere detail that
the Professor overlooks.  It gives a feeling of security and
restfulness to the history recitation, that is entirely lacking in
chemistry.</p><p>Sixth-hour bell--I must go to the laboratory and look into a little
matter of acids and salts and alkalis.  I've burned a hole as big as a
plate in the front of my chemistry apron, with hydrochloric acid.  If
the theory worked, I ought to be able to neutralize that hole with good
strong ammonia, oughtn't I?</p><p>Examinations next week, but who's afraid?</p></div> </div>
