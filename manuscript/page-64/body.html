shall be studying it.  I shall be about to have been studying it.  My
re-examination comes the 7th hour next Tuesday, and I am going to pass
or BUST.  So you may expect to hear from me next, whole and happy and
free from conditions, or in fragments.</p><p>I will write a respectable letter when it's over.  Tonight I have a
pressing engagement with the Ablative Absolute.</p></div> </div>
