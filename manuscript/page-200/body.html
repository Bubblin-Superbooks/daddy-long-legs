and not see anybody else?</p><p>A very beautiful lady in a very beautiful velvet dress got into the car
today, and without the slightest expression sat for fifteen minutes and
looked at a sign advertising suspenders.  It doesn't seem polite to
ignore everybody else as though you were the only important person
present.  Anyway, you miss a lot.  While she was absorbing that silly
sign, I was studying a whole car full of interesting human beings.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">The accompanying illustration is hereby reproduced</p></div> </div>
