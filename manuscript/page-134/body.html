had a parade of all the classes, with everybody dressed in white linen,
the Seniors carrying blue and gold Japanese umbrellas, and the juniors
white and yellow banners.  Our class had crimson balloons--very
fetching, especially as they were always getting loose and floating
off--and the Freshmen wore green tissue-paper hats with long streamers.
Also we had a band in blue uniforms hired from town.  Also about a
dozen funny people, like clowns in a circus, to keep the spectators
entertained between events.</p></div> </div>
