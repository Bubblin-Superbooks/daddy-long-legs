doubt about it, I'm a very languid Latin scholar.  We've finished Livy
and De Senectute and are now engaged with De Amicitia (pronounced Damn
Icitia).</p><p>Should you mind, just for a little while, pretending you are my
grandmother?  Sallie has one and Julia and Leonora each two, and they
were all comparing them tonight.  I can't think of anything I'd rather
have; it's such a respectable relationship.  So, if you really don't
object--When I went into town yesterday, I saw the sweetest cap of
Cluny lace trimmed with lavender ribbon.  I am going to make you a
present of it on your eighty-third birthday.</p><p>! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !</p><p>That's the clock in the chapel tower striking twelve.  I believe I am
