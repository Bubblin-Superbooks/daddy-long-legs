<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,</p><p>Thank you for permission to visit Julia--I take it that silence means
consent.</p><p>Such a social whirl as we've been having!  The Founder's dance came
last week--this was the first year that any of us could attend; only
upper classmen being allowed.</p><p>I invited Jimmie McBride, and Sallie invited his room-mate at
Princeton, who visited them last summer at their camp--an awfully nice
man with red hair--and Julia invited a man from New York, not very
exciting, but socially irreproachable.  He is connected with the De la
Mater Chichesters.  Perhaps that means something to you?  It doesn't
illuminate me to any extent.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">However--our guests came Friday afternoon in time for tea in the senior
corridor, and then dashed down to the hotel for dinner.  The hotel was
so full that they slept in rows on the billiard tables, they say.
Jimmie</p></div> </div>
