not feel that I can keep it.  My allowance is sufficient to afford all
of the hats that I need.  I am sorry that I wrote all that silly stuff
about the millinery shop; it's just that I had never seen anything like
it before.</p><p>However, I wasn't begging!  And I would rather not accept any more
charity than I have to.</p><pre class="  "><code>               Sincerely yours,
