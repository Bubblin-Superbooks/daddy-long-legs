<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">Pendleton used to own this farm, but now he has given
it to Mrs. Semple who was his old nurse.  Did you ever hear of such a
funny coincidence?  She still calls him 'Master Jervie' and talks about
what a sweet little boy he used to be.  She has one of his baby curls
put away in a box, and it is red--or at least reddish!</p><p>Since she discovered that I know him, I have risen very much in her
opinion.  Knowing a member of the Pendleton family is the best
introduction one can have at Lock Willow.  And the cream of the whole
family is Master Jervis--I am pleased to say that Julia belongs to an
inferior branch.</p><p>The farm gets more and more entertaining.  I rode on a hay wagon
yesterday.  We have three big pigs and nine little piglets, and you
should see them eat.  They are pigs!  We've oceans of little baby
chickens and ducks and turkeys and guinea fowls.  You must be mad to
live in a city when you might live on a farm.</p></div> </div>
