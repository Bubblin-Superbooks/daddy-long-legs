<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>I'd got just that much written, when--what do you think happened?  The
maid arrived with Master Jervie's card.  He is going abroad too this
summer; not with Julia and her family, but entirely by himself I told
him that you had invited me to go with a lady who is chaperoning a
party of girls.  He knows about you, Daddy.  That is, he knows that my
father and mother are dead, and that a kind gentleman is sending me to
college; I simply didn't have the courage to tell him about the John
Grier Home and all the rest.  He thinks that you are my guardian and a
perfectly legitimate old family friend.  I have never told him that I
didn't know you--that would seem too queer!</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Anyway, he insisted on my going to Europe.  He said that it was a
necessary part of my education and that I mustn't think of refusing.
Also, that he would be in Paris at the same time, and that we would run
away from the chaperon occasionally and have dinner</p></div> </div>
