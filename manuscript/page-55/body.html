<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>We had a molasses candy pull last Friday evening, given by the house
matron of Fergussen to the left-behinds in the other halls.  There were
twenty-two of us altogether, Freshmen and Sophomores and juniors and
Seniors all united in amicable accord.  The kitchen is huge, with
copper pots and kettles hanging in rows on the stone wall--the littlest
casserole among them about the size of a wash boiler.  Four hundred
girls live in Fergussen.  The chef, in a white cap and apron, fetched
out twenty-two other white caps and aprons--I can't imagine where he
got so many--and we all turned ourselves into cooks.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">It was great fun, though I have seen better candy.  When it was finally
finished, and ourselves and the kitchen and the door-knobs all
thoroughly sticky, we organized a procession and still in our caps and
aprons, each carrying a big fork or spoon or frying pan, we marched
through the empty corridors to the officers'</p></div> </div>
