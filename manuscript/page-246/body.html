<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">brought a momentary reminder that the world
at large exists.  Poor Jimmie is having a hard time peddling his bonds.
The 'Farmers' National' at the Corners wouldn't have anything to do
with them in spite of the fact that they pay six per cent.  interest
and sometimes seven.  I think he'll end up by going home to Worcester
and taking a job in his father's factory.  He's too open and confiding
and kind-hearted ever to make a successful financier.  But to be the
manager of a flourishing overall factory is a very desirable position,
don't you think?  Just now he turns up his nose at overalls, but he'll
come to them.</p><p>I hope you appreciate the fact that this is a long letter from a person
with writer's cramp.  But I still love you, Daddy dear, and I'm very
happy.  With beautiful scenery all about, and lots to eat and a
comfortable four-post bed and a ream of blank paper and a pint of
ink--what more does one want in the world?</p></div> </div>
