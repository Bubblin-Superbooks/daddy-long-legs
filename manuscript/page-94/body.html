me of you.</p><p>We hitched up the spring wagon this morning and drove to the Centre to
church.  It's a sweet little white frame church with a spire and three
Doric columns in front (or maybe Ionic--I always get them mixed).</p><p>A nice sleepy sermon with everybody drowsily waving palm-leaf fans, and
the only sound, aside from the minister, the buzzing of locusts in the
trees outside.  I didn't wake up till I found myself on my feet singing
the hymn, and then I was awfully sorry I hadn't listened to the sermon;
I should like to know more of the psychology of a man who would pick
out such a hymn.  This was it:</p><pre><code>       Come, leave your sports and earthly toys
       And join me in celestial joys.
       Or else, dear friend, a long farewell.
       I leave you now to sink to hell.</code></pre></div> </div>
