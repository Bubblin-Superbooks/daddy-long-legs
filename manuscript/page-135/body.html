<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>Julia was dressed as a fat country man with a linen duster and whiskers
and baggy umbrella.  Patsy Moriarty (Patrici really.  Did you ever hear
such a name?  Mrs. Lippett couldn't have done better) who is tall and
thin was Julia's wife in a absurd green bonnet over one ear.  Waves of
laughter followed them the whole length of the course.  Julia played
the part extremely well.  I never dreamed that a Pendleton could
display so much comedy spirit--begging Master Jervie's pardon; I don't
consider him a true Pendleton though, any more than I consider you a
true Trustee.</p><p>Sallie and I weren't in the parade because we were entered for the
events.  And what do you think?  We both won!  At least in something.
We tried for the running broad jump and lost; but Sallie won the
pole-vaulting (seven feet three inches) and I won the fifty-yard sprint
(eight seconds).</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">I was pretty panting at the end, but it was great fun,</p></div> </div>
