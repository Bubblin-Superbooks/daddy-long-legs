<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>I wish Mrs. Lippett would use a little more ingenuity about choosing
babies' names.  She gets the last names out of the telephone
book--you'll find Abbott on the first page--and she picks the Christian
names up anywhere; she got Jerusha from a tombstone.  I've always hated
it; but I rather like Judy.  It's such a silly name.  It belongs to the
kind of girl I'm not--a sweet little blue-eyed thing, petted and
spoiled by all the family, who romps her way through life without any
cares.  Wouldn't it be nice to be like that?  Whatever faults I may
have, no one can ever accuse me of having been spoiled by my family!
But it's great fun to pretend I've been.  In the future please always
address me as Judy.</p><p>Do you want to know something?  I have three pairs of kid gloves.  I've
had kid mittens before from the Christmas tree, but never real kid
gloves with five fingers.  I take them out and try them on every little
while.  It's all I can do not to wear them to classes.</p></div> </div>
