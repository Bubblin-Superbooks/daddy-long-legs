McBride that my mother and father were dead, and that a kind old
gentleman was sending me to college which is entirely true so far as it
goes.  I don't want you to think I am a coward, but I do want to be
like the other girls, and that Dreadful Home looming over my childhood
is the one great big difference.  If I can turn my back on that and
shut out the remembrance, I think, I might be just as desirable as any
other girl.  I don't believe there's any real, underneath difference,
do you?</p><p>Anyway, Sallie McBride likes me!</p><pre><code>                       Yours ever,
