do, and there isn't going to be any turning back.  It is very sweet and
generous and dear of you to wish to send me to Europe this summer--for
the moment I was intoxicated by the idea; but sober second thoughts
said no.  It would be rather illogical of me to refuse to take your
money for college, and then use it instead just for amusement!  You
mustn't get me used to too many luxuries.  One doesn't miss what one
has never had; but it's awfully hard going without things after one</p></div> </div>
