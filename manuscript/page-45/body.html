satisfactorily--until I reach the top of your head, and then I AM
stuck.  I can't decide whether you have white hair or black hair or
sort of sprinkly grey hair or maybe none at all.</p><p>Here is your portrait:</p><p>But the problem is, shall I add some hair?</p><p>Would you like to know what colour your eyes are?  They're grey, and
your eyebrows stick out like a porch roof (beetling, they're called in
novels), and your mouth is a straight line with a tendency to turn down
at the corners.  Oh, you see, I know!  You're a snappy old thing with a
temper.</p></div> </div>
