eighteen years in the John Grier Home, and then suddenly to be plunged
into the WORLD.</p><p>But I'm getting acclimated.  I don't make such awful mistakes as I did;
and I don't feel uncomfortable any more with the other girls.  I used

right through my sham new clothes to the checked ginghams underneath.
But I'm not letting the ginghams bother me any more.  Sufficient unto
yesterday is the evil thereof.</p><p>I forgot to tell you about our flowers.  Master Jervie gave us each a
big bunch of violets and lilies-of-the-valley. Wasn't that sweet of
him?  I never used to care much for men--judging by Trustees--but I'm
changing my mind.</p><p>Eleven pages--this is a letter!  Have courage.  I'm going to stop.</p></div> </div>
