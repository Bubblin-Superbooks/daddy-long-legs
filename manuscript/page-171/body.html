<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>You should see the sky!  There's the queerest orange-coloured light
over everything.  We're going to have a storm.</p><p>It commenced just that moment with tremendously big drops and all the
shutters banging.  I had to run to close the windows, while Carrie flew
to the attic with an armful of milk pans to put under the places where
the roof leaks and then, just as I was resuming my pen, I remembered
that I'd left a cushion and rug and hat and Matthew Arnold's poems
under a tree in the orchard, so I dashed out to get them, all quite
soaked.  The red cover of the poems had run into the inside; Dover
Beach in the future will be washed by pink waves.</p><p>A storm is awfully disturbing in the country.  You are always having to
think of so many things that are out of doors and getting spoiled.</p><pre><code>                                               Thursday</code></pre><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Daddy!  Daddy!  What do you think?  The postman</p></div> </div>
