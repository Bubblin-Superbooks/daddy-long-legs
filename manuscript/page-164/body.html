Master Jervie did the cooking; he said he knew how better than me and
he did, too, because he's used to camping.  Then we came down by
moonlight, and, when we reached the wood trail where it was dark, by
the light of an electric bulb that he had in his pocket.  It was such
fun!  He laughed and joked all the way and talked about interesting
things.  He's read all the books I've ever read, and a lot of others
besides.  It's astonishing how many different things he knows.</p><p>We went for a long tramp this morning and got caught in a storm.  Our
clothes were drenched before we reached home but our spirits not even
damp.  You should have seen Mrs. Semple's face when we dripped into her
kitchen.</p><p>'Oh, Master Jervie--Miss Judy!  You are soaked through.  Dear!  Dear!
What shall I do?  That nice new coat is perfectly ruined.'</p></div> </div>
