<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Saturday night</code></pre><p>Dearest Daddy-Long-Legs,</p><p>I've only just come and I'm not unpacked, but I can't wait to tell you
how much I like farms.  This is a heavenly, heavenly, HEAVENLY spot!
The house is square like this:  And OLD.  A hundred years or so.  It
has a veranda on the side which I can't draw and a sweet porch in
front.  The picture really doesn't do it justice--those things that
look like feather dusters are maple trees, and the prickly ones that
border the drive are murmuring pines and hemlocks.  It stands on the
top of a hill and looks way off over miles of green meadows to another
line of hills.</p><p>That is the way Connecticut goes, in a series of Marcelle waves; and
Lock Willow Farm is just on the crest of one wave.  The barns used to
be across the road where they obstructed the view, but a kind flash of
lightning came from heaven and burnt them down.</p></div> </div>
