<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>I find that it isn't safe to discuss religion with the Semples.  Their
God (whom they have inherited intact from their remote Puritan
ancestors) is a narrow, irrational, unjust, mean, revengeful, bigoted
Person.  Thank heaven I don't inherit God from anybody!  I am free to
make mine up as I wish Him.  He's kind and sympathetic and imaginative
and forgiving and understanding--and He has a sense of humour.</p><p>I like the Semples immensely; their practice is so superior to their
theory.  They are better than their own God.  I told them so--and they
are horribly troubled.  They think I am blasphemous--and I think they
are!  We've dropped theology from our conversation.</p><p>This is Sunday afternoon.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Amasai (hired man) in a purple tie and some bright yellow buckskin
