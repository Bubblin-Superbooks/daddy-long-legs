Mr. McBride owns a factory and Christmas eve he had a tree for the
employees' children.  It was in the long packing-room which was
decorated with evergreens and holly.  Jimmie McBride was dressed as
Santa Claus and Sallie and I helped him distribute the presents.</p><p>Dear me, Daddy, but it was a funny sensation!  I felt as benevolent as
a Trustee of the John Grier home.  I kissed one sweet, sticky little
boy--but I don't think I patted any of them on the head!</p><p>And two days after Christmas, they gave a dance at their own house for
ME.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">It was the first really true ball I ever attended--college doesn't
count where we dance with girls.  I had a new white evening gown (your
Christmas present--many thanks) and long white gloves and white satin
slippers. </p></div> </div>
