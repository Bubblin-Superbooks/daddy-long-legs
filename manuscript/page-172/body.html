<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">has just come with two
letters.</p><p>1st.  My story is accepted.  $50.</p><p>ALORS!  I'm an AUTHOR.</p><p>2nd.  A letter from the college secretary.  I'm to have a scholarship
for two years that will cover board and tuition.  It was founded for
'marked proficiency in English with general excellency in other lines.'
And I've won it!  I applied for it before I left, but I didn't have an
idea I'd get it, on account of my Freshman bad work in maths and Latin.
But it seems I've made it up.  I am awfully glad, Daddy, because now I
won't be such a burden to you.  The monthly allowance will be all I'll
need, and maybe I can earn that with writing or tutoring or something.</p><p>I'm LONGING to go back and begin work.</p><pre class="  "><code>               Yours ever,
